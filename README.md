# A Tic-Tac-Toe game in Rust

My code project for the 2023 summer vacation was to convert a Swift tac-tac-toe game that I have previously written to the Rust language and learn some Rust doing it. 

It was a fun experience and I really enjoyed learning the basics of Rust.

Some features

* Play as X or O against the computer
* Random selection of who starts
* Most functions have unit tests
* computer vs computer is also a test. The output of the computer playing aginst itself can be viewed by selecting profile "Unit test with output" as "Run and Debug" profile in VS Code.


To do

* Add neural network that can be trained by playing the current game algorithm
